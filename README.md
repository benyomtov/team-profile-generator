# Team Profile Generator
  

  ## Description
  
  This is a command-line application that generates a styled webpage with information on members of a coding team. The user can add a manager and as many interns and engineers that they choose. For each employee, a series of questions are asked about the team member based on their role in the team, and once the user is finished inputting the information on their coding team, they can choose to generate their webpage. This application is designed to make it easier to access information for members of a coding team.
